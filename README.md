## **USING COLOR IN MAPPING**

## **Why is Color Important**

Color is an extremely important component to map making, as it is an element which instantly 
communicates a theme or idea to an audience. Decision in color are vital in making a map
 that is visually pleasing, elegant, clear, and professional.

## **Color Fundamentals**

Hue, Saturation, and Lightness (value)

## **Lightness**

The lightness, or value, of a color is how light or dark a color is. Using different lightness
values of the same hue is the best way to display quantitative data, or to shows a sequential
pattern. Usually in this type of mapping, light colors are usually associated with low data
values, dark colors with high data values.

Fig 1. Notice how the blue in the lake goes from light to dark- dark symbolizing deep water, and light symbolizing
shallow water.

## **Hue**

Hue is the perceptual dimension of color we associate with color names. In mapping, different
hues are used to display different feature types, and to show qualitative data. Assorted colors
represent different kinds of map features or categories that are not ordered. When using hues
to help distinguish features, it is important to choose ones that one can easily tell apart
from the other when right next to each other.

Fig 2. This is a choropleth map of New York City which shows the distribution of different ethnicities
symbolized by different hues.

## **Saturation**

Saturation basically describes a colors distance from gray, or the vividness of the color.
Colors that have a high saturation are more vivid and bright, less saturated color are closer
to gray. Saturation doesnâ€™t have its own explicit use like lightness and hue, but rather it
is used to reinforce lightness change to help distinguish map symbols or to make colors more
subdued.

Fig 3. This map shows how saturation can be used to highlight smaller areas which can be otherwise lost in a map.
For example, the Urban areas are depicted in a more saturated, bright color compared to the rest of the map in order for it be seen.

## **Divergent Colors**

Divergent color schemes utilize both hue and lightness to display data, specifically when there
is a midpoint and two opposite extremes

Fig 4. This choropleth map has a divergent color scheme, where it used two hues (green and brown) and varying
values of those colors.

## **Choosing the right colors**

As a rule of thumb, it is good to make natural features their natural color, although there are
many exceptions. It is also important to use colors that fit the theme of your map, for examples
properly using cool or warm colors to highlight a theme.

 hues to tell apart the different basins.
